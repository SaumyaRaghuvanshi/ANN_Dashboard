# 📊 ANN Sales Prediction Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a powerful **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for **sales prediction** using historical retail data. The model is integrated within an interactive dashboard and designed to empower businesses with **data-driven decision-making**, enabling better forecasting, resource allocation, and marketing strategy optimization.

## 🔧 What This Project Offers  
- A **complete deep learning pipeline**: From raw data preprocessing to model evaluation  
- **Interactive visualization support** using Google Colab and plotting libraries  
- **Customizable ANN architecture** with hyperparameter tuning  
- Real-time model performance tracking through evaluation metrics and plots  
- Business-friendly insights, such as **feature importance, actual vs predicted sales, and residual analysis**

## 🧱 Core Components

### 1. **Data Engineering**
- The dataset, sourced from retail store sales records, is cleaned, transformed, and engineered for model readiness.
- Missing values are imputed, outliers managed, and irrelevant features dropped.
- New features such as `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `WeekOfYear`, and `IsWeekend` are derived from the `Date` column.
- Categorical features are encoded, and all numerical data is standardized to improve training efficiency.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
- A multi-layer ANN is constructed using **TensorFlow/Keras**, with optional dropout, batch normalization, and regularization.
- Activation functions such as **LeakyReLU** help address vanishing gradient problems, ensuring stable training.
- The model supports different optimizers: **Adam**, **SGD**, and **RMSprop**, with tunable learning rates and epochs.

### 3. **Training & Evaluation**
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80/20).
- During training, loss and MAE are monitored on both training and validation sets.
- Post-training, the model is evaluated using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **R² Score**

## 📊 Visual Insights
The dashboard provides various visualizations that help interpret the model’s behavior:

- **Loss and MAE Curves** – Visual tracking of training and validation performance over epochs  
- **Actual vs Predicted Sales** – Scatter plot to assess prediction accuracy  
- **Residual Plot** – To evaluate model bias and variance across prediction ranges  
- **Feature Importance Chart** – Derived from the ANN’s first layer weights, this shows which features most influenced the predictions  
- **Sales Distribution Plots** – Comparison of data before and after preprocessing

## 🧠 Business Impact
This model is more than a technical exercise—it's a tool for **business intelligence**. It enables:
- Better **sales forecasting and inventory planning**
- More accurate **budgeting and promotion impact estimation**
- Informed **resource distribution** across store locations and campaigns
- Detection of **seasonality and behavioral patterns** in consumer activity

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
This project sets the stage for more advanced applications:
- **Deployment via APIs** for real-time sales prediction in production
- **Model interpretability enhancements** using SHAP or LIME
- **Ensemble modeling** for improved robustness
- **Integration with business dashboards** like Power BI or Tableau
- **Real-time streaming** support using tools like Kafka or Spark
